         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>What <hi>Saul</hi> did, is legible before, written in bloudy Characters, which will remaine unto the worlds end. By who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e inſtigation he did it? This is as legible alſo: By the inſtigation of the Divel, vexing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53877:9"/>and tormenting <hi>Saul,</hi> effectually working in him, together with his owne ſpirit, thereby agitated, ſtirred-up, and boyled to the heigth of extreme wrath, againſt <hi>David,</hi> and all thoſe that wiſhed well unto, or had their <hi>hand with David.</hi> This being premiſed, I conclude firſt,</p>
                  <p>That Conſcience could not hold-backe Iſrael from helping their Brethren in the day of diſtreſſe, and treading downe, for who did ſo oppreſſe Iſrael at this time? It muſt be anſwered, <hi>Saul their King:</hi> for he had hands and feet, and other Inſtruments beſides, to execute the wrath; but all he did was by the divels motion, that <hi>Evill ſpirit</hi> upon him, which hurried him from place to place, ſo as he did not goe, but was driven; and all his way long he breathed out threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt <hi>David:</hi> By the motion of this <hi>Evill ſpirit,</hi> and his <hi>owne</hi> (which every man, <hi>Saul</hi> alſo, are bound to reſiſt) did <hi>Saul</hi> doe all this; Therefore whatſoever Iſrael makes conſcience of, they cannot make conſcience of reſiſting the divell, or the <hi>private will,</hi> which by the helpe of the divell, has done all the violences that ever were done in the world. I preſume this is a cleared caſe, therefore I leave it; for if <hi>Saul,</hi> acted by an <hi>Evill ſpirit,</hi> will flye at Iſraels throat, they can make no <hi>conſcience</hi> in the world to reſiſt him, I meane the bloudy actings, and notorious violences of the divell.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Iſrael muſt looke upon <hi>Saul</hi> now, the great <hi>Fiduciary</hi> of the Kingdome, betraying that truſt into an Edomites hand; then ſmiting Iſraels City, Man and Beaſt there. <hi>Conſcience</hi> well informed now, calls-in Iſrael to help their diſtreſſed Brethren, ſo far as was in the power of their hands to helpe: grant ſo much power in their hands, that they could and were able to relieve their Brethren, and yet would not, then <hi>Conſcience</hi> will be ſo far from pleading their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, that it will condemne them as acceſſary to that murder and bloodſhed.

                     <hi>Our hands have not ſhed this bloud, nor have our eyes ſeene it:</hi> That is, <hi>Conſcience</hi> to quit their Eyes in this caſe, as well as their hands; had their Eyes ſeene innocent bloud-ſhedding (as in this caſe) and not come-in to reſcue the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, they had not been innocent.

                  <p>Thirdly, they had ſhewne mercy indeed to <hi>Saul</hi> their Maſter, even to his ſoule, could they have conjured that <hi>Evill ſpirit,</hi> and overcome
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53877:10"/>him, ſolacing and delighting himſelfe (as his manner is) <hi>in proud wrath,</hi> and wherewith their Maſter <hi>Saul</hi> was ſore vexed, that (like the Lunaticke man) he falls oft times into the fire and oft times into the water <hi>(i.e.)</hi> into moſt imminent apparent, and deſtructive dangers. Doubtleſſe it had been a point of pure love, duty and conſcience, to have reſiſted him, to have with-held him, driving-on furiouſly to ſhed bloud: Had Iſrael done ſo, they had ſhewne themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious men, who underſtood their duty, and entirely loved their King, and therefore would not ſuffer him to doe that, which would undoe him for ever. O! it had been an act of mercy, and of a well inſtructed conſcience, if Iſrael had, every man to his power, as one man ſtept-in, and withſtood <hi>Saul</hi> in his bloudy way: and all the true Iſrael in the world would have acquitted them ſo doing, and ſaid, <hi>in meere pitty and compaſsion to</hi> Saul, <hi>and that which ſhould be deareſt unto him have they done this, with-held their Maſter from ſhedding bloud.</hi> Nay, <hi>Saul</hi> himſelfe, had he ever come to himſelfe (but the Evill ſpirit haunted him to the day of his death) would have thanked Iſrael for ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>But here, though nothing can be ſaid for <hi>Saul</hi> in juſtification of what he did, yet much is ſaid againſt them that had any hand with <hi>David.</hi> That they were Rebells and Traitors all againſt the King, and ſo <hi>Saul</hi> himſelfe chargeth all his ſervants, and all the Prieſts too; <hi>All of you have conſpired againſt me,</hi>

                  <p>But if Iſrael,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> ſtanding up in their own defence, had not withſtood <hi>Saul,</hi> yet they had <hi>reſiſted the ordinance of God,</hi> and they muſt make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience there.</p>

We are reſolved in this caſe of conſcience touching the Edomite, <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> of him. But here is a greater caſe; If wee reſiſt the Edomite in our ſenſe, and in Scripture language, That Legion of the Papiſts, now <hi>Raging</hi> and <hi>Rioting</hi> in our Land, we ſhall reſiſt the King too; for this Edomite is the chiefe MANA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GER (next to the Divel) of all the Kings affaires in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome his very beſt Subjects, and trueſt Friends. O horrible, what words are theſe! Papiſts his beſt Subjects! It muſt paſſe, for it has the Kings allowance, he has declared it ſo, he has proclaimed it ſo, once and againe, and a third time: The <hi>Edomites</hi> in Ireland, in England, they are the Kings beſt Subjects, thoſe he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide-in, his heart may cleave to them in love, when <hi>David, The faithfull of the LORD,</hi> are called <hi>Traitors</hi> every day, and his good People <hi>Rebels</hi> all. O <hi>David</hi> cannot be ſilent now any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; GOD knowes, and all the Chriſtian world knowes, <hi>Davids</hi> heart is upright, and his hands cleare, and his prayer pure touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter; <hi>Their hands have not ſhed innocent bloud,</hi> nor have <hi>their eyes ſeen it, but with indignation and Zeale</hi> againſt theſe Murtherers. And we ſay, That many Kings have beene ſeduced by evill counſels, Many, whoſe hearts have beene ſtolne away from their good people; and given-up into their enemies hands cleaving to them in love; and ſome have ſhed bloud to their power, as <hi>Saul</hi> here, and others after him. But, oh, how loth I am to ſpeake! The Evill Counſellours have carried-on the King in the Path of the deſtroyer, beyond all Theſe, for he has given a Commiſſion to deſtroy his good people, and makes ſhewes, <hi>That his ſoule bleeds over them:</hi> He pittieth his Peoples naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and takes from them their cloathes; hee calls them Rebels in Ireland, and entertaines the ſame Rebels here; He profeſſeth to do all by helpe of GOD and the <hi>Law;</hi> and all he does, has a manifeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to GOD, and contradiction to the Law. He profeſſeth with his tongue to be for Religion indeed; when his heart and hand is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly againſt the profeſſors of the ſame. To take them from the Earth. He profeſſeth to maintaine his Peoples liberties and does all. that is in the power of his hands to inthrall, and oppreſſe his people; To make their neckes bend to the Edomites yoake; he would make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53877:14"/>his hand goes along with GOD, when hee puts it forth againſt The Almighty, in all his peoples ſight, as if he had an arm like GOD. But the bloudſhed in both his Kingdomes, this The <hi>Lord</hi> ſees, and heares the voice of it too; And, which maketh the voice yet louder, The LORD heares how he chargeth it upon the innocent, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Murtherers, thoſe that have ſhed it indeed. The LORD lay it cloſe to the heart of his Majeſty, that his ſoule may <hi>bleed over the blood he hath ſhed;</hi> That he may forbeare to ſay ſo, till he does ſo; That his ſoule may ſhed teares for the bloud he hath ſhed, indeed and indeed. Let others pray, <hi>The LORD bring his Majeſty home to his Parliament upon the wings of the Churches Prayers;</hi> They that pray ſo, pray well; but they pray better, who pray, <hi>The Lord open the Kings eyes and heart, that he may diſcerne the Path he has trod, the way he is in, and feele the working of that</hi> bloud ſhed <hi>upon his ſoule, working in him a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row after a godly ſort; The LORD ſhew him the falſhood, the hypocriſie of his heart, make it as manifeſt to him, as it is to all his good People, That his</hi> uncircumciſed heart may be humbled, <hi>that he may abhorre evill, and loath himſelfe for what he has done.</hi> Amen, ſay I, and all who wiſh that his ſoule may proſper. He may come home to his Parliament, and doe more hurt then good there, unleſſe his heart be humbled for all he has done firſt,</p>
                  <p>I remember very well, the <hi>Eleventh King of Scotland</hi> (the worſt King that ever was, I thinke, yet) was brought home to his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I meane, he came-up to his good People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even to all the deſire of their hearts; for thus he did. Thoſe pernicious Counfellors [he had many, and they ſtole away his heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or he ſtole away theirs: ſurely the King was worſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe chiefeſt in the treſpaſſe] he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be impriſoned, and over ſome the wheele was turned: And all this he did in deep diſſimulation, that he might the more freely, with no reſiſtance, worke-out his owne <hi>will,</hi> and doe according to his owne pleaſure afterwards. And ſo he did; the yeare after, by that time he ſaw all cleare before him, the hearts of his Nobles gained; for he gave the offenders into their hands, and all was well: and now they muſt be feaſted. They were glad of that, and to ſupper they came, which was ſerved-up in a <hi>Lordly diſh;</hi> and after the meat, Wine: they are, and dranke, and their hearts were merry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the worſt Wine was kept laſt; towards the cloſe of the Feaſt, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were made drunke with their owne bloud, as with ſweet Wine: A few eſcaped, and thoſe few (by the helpe of the People) roſe-up againſt their King, and ſlew him. I ſhall not meddle with that, though in the cloſe of the worke, I ſhall point to that King againe, and another halfe as bad.</p>
                  <p>I conclude from hence, That till the King be truly informed for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53877:15"/>what he has done, That he has walked in the counſell of the ungodly; his foot has ſtood in the way of ſinners; and he ſitteth in the ſeat of the ſcornfull; Till his heart be humbled for this, T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray we; <q rend="inline">LORD turne the heart of the King, give him a ſight of what he has done, and humble his ſoule in the ſight of it; th the hath blaſphemed the Name of his GOD; deal deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his Maker; treacherouoy with His People; abominably with His Day, prophaning it by a Law.</q> He muſt be <hi>reſtleſſe</hi> in his ſpirit till he hath vindicated That diſhonour done to That <hi>Reſt;</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and perſecuting His beſt Servants, touching that matter, and ſhedding their bloud to his power ever ſince. LORD give the King a ſight of all this, and of all that The <hi>Searcher of hearts,</hi> and his owne heart knowes by himſelfe, and kindly humble him for all. Then all the reſt followes, the King will be <hi>right</hi> for his Parliament, his heart will be with them; then it will be ſaid, and not till then, <hi>What the King does pleaſeth all his people; and what his good people doe, pleaſeth the King.</hi> Amen:</p>
                  <p>But if the King doe not his duty, his people muſt doe theirs; if hee looke not to his charge how he rules, not his, but <hi>Gods People,</hi> [THY PEOPLE] ſitting in GODS Throne; Yet muſt the people look to their obedience; they muſt be ſubject to the <hi>higher Power</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.

So long as theſe ſhall be ſpoken of, will the injuſtice, the bloudy proceedings of the King, (in the hands of bloudy Counſellours) be remembred alſo, to all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations. We ſhall tell it to our children and they to their children, That the King of England would have oppreſſed his owne people; he would have inthralled their Lawes, Liberties, Religion; And for the maintenance of all theſe, their lives and all that was deare unto them, did his people ſo <hi>fortifie</hi> and <hi>Breaſt-worke</hi> themſelves, againſt the fury and rage of their King, in the hands of bloudy perſecuters. The Caſe of Conſcience now.</p>
                  <p>The People muſt not ſtand up for their lives and liberties,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> againſt murtherers, for if they ſtand up againſt them, they ſtand up againſt their King.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>All this is good Grammar, but the worſt <hi>Logicke</hi> that ever I read, for there is no <hi>Reaſon</hi> in it at all: No Reaſon at all, that the Subject, whom <hi>God</hi> has made a man, endowed him with a reaſonable Soule; That this man ſhould be <hi>Adjective,</hi> wholly at the diſpoſe and will of his Prince, ſo dependant upon him; of the ſame minde and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though the Princes minde be moſt contrary to the minde of Chriſt.

                  <p>We have ſeene now what Perſons they ever have beene, and are, who have their hand againſt <hi>David, murtherers</hi> all, <hi>mighty hunters before The LORD.</hi> And yet as I am not ſo fooliſhly ignorant, to thinke. That the vile Prieſts were not a part of <hi>Sauls</hi> Army, either in Action, or Affection, contributing their Prayers, and Purſes towards the <hi>holy warre,</hi> wherein, they alwayes have beene a willing people, of very large hearts: So I am not ſo uncharitable, as to thinke, That all <hi>theſe three thouſand</hi> were all murtherers; They that were acquainred with <hi>Sauls</hi> minde, and willingly <hi>followed the Commandement,</hi> Thoſe all were murtherers in the higheſt degree, there is no doubt of all that. But ſome there were, a very few, who followed <hi>Saul,</hi> and croſſed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, what they could; So did <hi>Jonathan;</hi> and how many more I cannot tell: And others there were, who followed <hi>Saul</hi> as ſheepe are driven by the Shepheard, when hee meanes to plunge them into the waters; They did not properly follow <hi>Saul,</hi> but were driven by the hand of violence, (as ſome of late have beene, and as <hi>Saul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was) by the Divell. To exemplifie this by the <hi>Edomites</hi> practice at this time: The <hi>Edomite</hi> now in the North (we have no other name for him) has exerciſed ſuch cruelties upon the inhabitants there, to force them to his ſide, tying their heads and heeles together, till from
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53877:23"/>ſome of them breath departed; And by theſe Turkiſh inforcements he has gained many bodies to his ſide, but <hi>David</hi> has their hearts. And ſo we may conceive, and ſo judge it was with men in <hi>Sauls</hi> Hoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Sacred Scripture gives us that allowance. For we reade of no execution done upon Iſrael, upon their Cities, but by <hi>Saul</hi> and the <hi>Edomite; Saul</hi> ſpake indeed to all his Servants.

                  <p>Thirdly, though we doe not queſtion <hi>Ionathans</hi> ſincerity, being well reſolved at that point, that he was a good man, and a true friend to <hi>David</hi> and did him great ſervice at the Court; yet I thinke wee may queſtion, whether his bands of nature, or Court-bands (all very ſtrong no doubt) were ſtrong enough to bind his bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to continue with his father, all the time his father perſecuted <hi>David.</hi> I determine nothing here, becauſe the Scripture is ſilent, but thus the Scripture ſpeakes out, and we may ſet a marke upon it, that if <hi>Ionathan</hi> was not ſlaine firſt (which yet the Text ſeemes to ſay) yet thus it was,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Saul died, and his three Sonnes and his Armour-bearer, and all his men that ſame day together:</hi> TOGETHER, they went along with <hi>Saul</hi> in a bloudy Path, he did drive-on furiouſly, but they went

Certainly, it is not ſafe to goe one ſtep forward with a man, when we ſee plainly what way he goes, and that he drives fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly on towards a curſed end. If we ſee two men <hi>walke together,</hi> we muſt needs thinke they are agreed, for ſo ſayes the Spirit, they cannot <hi>walke together</hi> elſe: yet we will not judge that all in the Kings Court are Enemies to <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We think rather, That ſome there be, whoſe body is with their King, and their heart with <hi>David.</hi> We acknowledge, That Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are binders; and Court-bands are ſhackles; But yet there is no ſuch binder in the world, as our engagement to <hi>David.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Saul</hi> called together his men, bade them follow him, doe as he did, purſue <hi>David,</hi> and ſhed bloud to their power:<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.28.</note> Be couragious <hi>and be valiant, have not I commanded you?</hi>

                  <p>The truth is, <hi>Sauls</hi> violent dealing with <hi>David,</hi> did <hi>David</hi> much good; he could not have wanted it: So likewiſe the treacherous dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the <hi>Keilites,</hi> and <hi>Ziphites,</hi> all this did him much good alſo. And

                  <p>The LORD had this deſigne now, He will make manifeſt the Adverſaries treachery, and His Servants innocency; and he brings it about thus: His Servants ſhall, becauſe they will, treat upon a way to accommodate a Peace: The LORD left men to goe their owne way, not ſo warrantable by His Word, to treat with impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable adverſaries, that He might bring to paſſe His owne will, and bring good to His people. It was conceived by all rationall men, that on the Kings party nothing was intended really and indeed, but miſchiefe and bloudy treachery, as is now manifeſt to the world; But GOD ſuffered it to goe on, brought <hi>ſweet</hi> out of that <hi>ſower,</hi> good out of that evill: The <hi>Evill ſpirit</hi> is ſilenced now, the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants have not what to ſay; O bleſſed be GOD!

This laſt Treaty betwixt King and Parliament, has <hi>non-pluſsed</hi> the Divell, his MANAGERS all are put to ſilence now, they have not what to ſay, and yet they are not aſhamed: True, the wicked <hi>cannot be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:</hi> Were they (ſayes the Spirit) <hi>aſhamed when they had committed abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> oppreſſed GODS <hi>Poore</hi> to their power, ſhed bloud to their power; profaned the LORDS DAY by a Law, when they endevoured to eſtabliſh their curſed <hi>Hitrarchy</hi> by an <hi>Oath,</hi> were they aſhamed?

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53877:33"/>out of ſight then now it is, for ought we know. But I pray you make anſwere to this, and conſider well on it; Has <hi>David</hi> been a loſer by any thing that has fallen out unto him all this long time (ſo hee thought it) of <hi>Sauls</hi> perſecution? No, you will ſay, for indeed you muſt ſay ſo; <hi>David</hi> has been a great gainer by all this, that hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto him in the day wherein the LORD was pleaſed to exerciſe him with ſore afflictions; he has gained experience of his owne ſpirit, how lying, warping, murmuring, haſty, proud, and ſtout it was; all this he has gained, and I know not how much more. He has gained a full ſight of all his adverſaries, their malice, treacheries, and falſhoods, are all made manifeſt; his adverſaries are convinced too, and the <hi>Evill ſpirit</hi> ſilenced alſo. Why then the Church will truſt in their GOD for ever; and well they may, the LORD deales ſo and ſo with <hi>David,</hi> His faithfull ſervant: He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laied <hi>Davids</hi> deliverance; it ſtayed, as a Child comming to the birth, when there is no power to bring forth; but yet all this <hi>ſlackneſſe</hi> (as we call it in our <hi>haſte</hi>) was but to open <hi>Davids</hi> mouth the wider, that he might be more filled with MICHTAMS, and with MAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHILS. Bleſſed be GOD then, that the Churches deliverance does ſeeme to linger, to be long a comming; Bleſſed be His Name, it is GODS doing, and he does <hi>all things well;</hi> and this He does now (deferring His Churches deliverance) is beſt of all: Is it not beſt of all, that the Church ſees now more clearly into the way of their owne ſpirits, and more through into the Path of the deſtroyer, and into the very intents and purpoſes of her Adverſaries? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if her deliverance be longer delayed (as we call delay) it is <hi>beſt</hi> for the Church ſtill, for all her <hi>ſtraits</hi> ſhall be a meanes to open her mouth the wider, to let in, and give forth her MICHTAMS, and her MASCHILS; If deliverance ſtayes, it is becauſe there muſt be more diſcovery yet, even of Gods <hi>Right-hand</hi> with <hi>David;</hi> and this comes now to be conſidered on, for it containes much.</p>

Hereon depends a very notable ſtory, becauſe of ſome very notable circumſtances thereabouts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpecially touching the <hi>ſword:</hi> An <hi>hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> inſtrument, but yet could do <hi>David no hurt,</hi> being wholly at <hi>Gods</hi> diſpoſe; and that is very comfortable, ſpecially at that time: which I would have inſiſted upon a little, but that I finde my ſelfe preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a little Paper, called, <hi>A ſtaffe of comfort,</hi> whereunto I referre the Reader, if pleaſe him.</p>
                  <p>That which concernes us here, is, <hi>David</hi> has put himſelfe upon a very hot ſervice, and overcomes where-ever he goes for he carries the Revenge of GOD with him. After execution done, he retires to <hi>Ziglag;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.3.</note> comming thither, he finds it <hi>ſmitten, and burnt with fire:</hi> the Amalekites had been there, had done as we read, and had taken thence all <hi>Davids</hi> earthly comforts, every one. Truely a very hard and ſad caſe; <hi>Saul</hi> has hunted him from all his ſtrong holds, thoſe in Iſrael, thoſe in the Wilderneſſe; and now by the favour of <hi>Achiſh,</hi> he has one City of Refuge more aſſigned to him, <hi>David</hi> is ſtept aſide,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53877:37"/>the Amalekites invade the City the while, <hi>Smite it, and burne it with fire,</hi> and take away all his comforts, the deſire of his eyes, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of his heart, all his comfort thence. He heares <hi>devouring</hi> words beſides, to adde to his griefe: Ah Lord! what a ſad caſe is this! I ſhall propoſe ſome Quere's about it anon, becauſe the reſolution thereunto will inſtruct us very much: It will ſtate, and reſolve our queſtions too; and if not ſatisfie us, yet will make us ſilent.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, obſerving my method all along hitherto, we muſt ſee how this relates to the preſent time alſo: And bleſſed be GOD we ſee it very clearly; it relates fully to our times, for our <hi>Ziglags</hi> are ſmitten and burnt with fire: Yes, and our caſe is more like <hi>Davids</hi> ſtill; <hi>David</hi> heares devouring words from thoſe he put as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in, as could be put upon men too much; Theſe talke of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him. It is our caſe too; we made <hi>lyes our refuge,</hi> we put confidence in men, becauſe they <hi>are many,</hi> in that Arm, becauſe it is ſtrong. And wha doe we heare? Surely that which troubles us as much as it did <hi>David,</hi> when his men ſpake of <hi>ſtoning him;</hi> That men will prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves men, deceitfull and treacherous; That there is as much or more danger from them, then from profeſſed Adverſaries. VVell, yes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is well, bleſſed be GOD; let Him take what way He pleaſeth, ſo He will caſt downe all our ſtrong-holds, our vaine confidences: I know the Adverſary laughs now; VVell; GOD laughes alſo, and His People may laugh too at their owne folly, and bee aſhamed alſo the more, the more they looked to multitudes; Should not a <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And ſee how graciouſly He has dealt with His Servants, that ſerve Him with a willing mind!

But give me leave to reaſon a little, as fleſh &amp; bloud will, whether we will or not: Though GOD has delivered, it does not therefore follow, that He will deliver; He had delivered His People from theſe and theſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, yet when His People had provoked Him by their images, and ſtrange vanities, the LORD tells them plainly, He <hi>will deliver them no more:</hi> And why may not we expect to heare the ſame words; <hi>Ye have rebelled more and more, therefore I will deliver you no more:</hi> We might indeed expect to heare the ſame words, if the LORD in ſhewing mercy to a land did conſult with the People of the Land, with their deſervings, and the merit of their workes: which he does not doe, but with His free Mercy, <hi>Goodneſſe,</hi> and <hi>loving Kindneſſes;</hi> conſulting with Himſelfe, He hath delivered us from SO GREAT A DEATH (marke that, SO GREAT A DEATH, for we had it not before) when the righteous were preſſed out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, above ſtrength; when they were brought to the brow and brinke of the hill, purpoſely to throw them downe headlong thence; when they deſpaired even of life: when the ſentence of death was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in themſelves; when GOD doth deliver after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as this, ſuch an unexpected glorious manner, which heaven and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53877:39"/>earth ſtand wondring at <hi>(from ſo great a death)</hi> when He turneth the cap ivity of a People as Jordan, back; when He worketh ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo wonderfully, this is an evident token, that, though the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be not perfected yet it is perfecting: The LORD doth watch over it and is working and contriving what way to make it more glorious, for His Name is engaged upon it: It may goe-backe till it be out of ſight; it may have many ſtops in comming-on againe; it may fall into the <hi>depths,</hi> where we can finde no bottome, nor any humane helpe whereby it may riſe again. Notwithſtanding GOD is working gloriouſly all this while; ſo as we may ſay even now, <hi>Now, when they that hate the Lord lift-up the head,</hi> why yet deliverance goes-on; the LORD watcheth it. and promoteth it, and, as it is in the Text. <hi>He dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Bleſſed be GOD, His ſervants have ſo fortified themſelves; and His bleſſings be upon the heads of thoſe, who have given forth their heart and hand to the raiſing theſe works; for I verily beleeve, theſe will be very ſerviceable to the Church till the very time when her LORD will make her <hi>a quiet habitation;</hi> all the time before is like to be <hi>Troublous.</hi> The meaning then is not, That theſe <hi>forts</hi> and <hi>breſt-workes,</hi> before our eyes, muſt be deſtroyed,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53877:41"/>before the Church is delivered, [though it is very notable, that ſo it was with <hi>David;</hi> all was downe before he was raiſed; quite forſaken before GOD took him up;] But all the Churches ſtrong-holds within muſt be deſtroyed, their vaine confidences, their breſt-works within, raiſed there by theſe without, making the Church confident and ſecure, <hi>truſting in them,</hi> theſe muſt be deſtroyed, before the Church can be delivered. Nay, if theſe breſt-workes and ſtrong holds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, be not deſtroyed, they will deſtroy us, they will put deliverance further backe, and deſtroy theſe without: I meane, our <hi>truſting in them,</hi> expecting ſalvation from them, will deſtroy us and them; it will bring a curſe upon all; <hi>the ſword ſhall impoveriſh thy fenced Cities,</hi> ſaith the LORD:<note place="margin">

                     <hi>This kind is not caſt forth but by Prayer and Faſting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I reply firſt, and doe grant,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>this kinde,</hi> while it does act as a <hi>ſpirit,</hi> is to be reſiſted by the <hi>ſpirit of Prayer,</hi> and ſo alwayes has beene caſt forth. But when his act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are more open and viſible upon any perſon, as upon that <hi>Lunatick</hi> there; Then, if there had beene force enough to reſiſt him, the father of the childe, would not have called it a <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> of his childe, which was but the reſtraining of the childe from falling into the <hi>fire, and into the water.</hi> So we ſee in this caſe, There might have been a <hi>reſiſting</hi> of the divell, which had had an affiance and good agreement with duty. Much more then, had this <hi>Lunaticke</hi> Perſon played the Edomite, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with his ſword, ſlaine all he met, man, woman, and childe, ſucklings too, beaſts alſo; made Cities ruinous heaps. Should Iſrael goe to prayer now? Pray the divell to be quiet; So they might have beene killed upon their knees. Iſrael knew the divell well enough, and the Edomite too. That the more they prayed them, the fiercer they would be, as <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> cried the louder in the Jewiſh language, the more he was prayed to ſpeake in the <hi>Syriacke</hi> tongue;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.28:</note> When the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell has put a ſword into an Edomites hand, we muſt not uſe ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, but put force to force, and conjure-out the divell with the Sword. If the divell make you bleed, try a concluſion, whether you cannot make the divell bleed; which is very poffible, ſayes <hi>Zanchie,</hi> and he has a large diſcourſe upon it, and touching the <hi>methods</hi> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. The divell acts now by the hand of an Edomite; he muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the hand of an Iſraelite. This firſt, I affirm,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Iſrael, Prieſts and People there, went by their Rule; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they had uſed all fair means before they tooke the ſword in hand. They had prayed for <hi>Saul,</hi> and to make their prayer the more fervent, they faſted for him alſo. But here was a ſad caſe (you read it before.) <hi>Saul</hi> has murthered thoſe Prieſts, who were the likelieſt men in all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah to pray and faſt for him; he murthered them. Indeed it was as ſad a caſe, as (I thinke) is imaginable; for, whereas he might have had groanes and Prayers put up to the throne of grace in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, from the Prieſts mouth, he makes the good Prieſts groane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his oppreſſion: The good Prieſts would have cryed for him, ſpake good for him before his and their LORD night and day: <hi>Saul</hi> regards not that, he has ſhed their bloud, and now their bloud

No ſooner this was ſpoken, and his ſpeech ended, but out he and the reſt went, Nobles and Commons, and to the Court gate. What is the mattes, ſayes the King? We will plucke the evill Counſellours from your ſide, ſaid they. The Queſtion was quick; the Anſwer was as quick:

                  <p>To conclude, we think GOD is long in comming, and ſalvation ſleepeth. No, GOD will come in the fitteſt ſeaſon; His ſalvation ſhall come, and not ſtay; It ſhall come, and in ſuch a ſeaſon, and in ſuch a glorious manner, as His people ſhall ſay, Salvation could not have come in a fitter time. It is certaine, that the Servants of The LORD ſhall acknowledge, they could not have wanted any one thing, Their LORD has done in ſhew and ſemblance for their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, and againſt them, His own people; their falling before their enemies, has made them fall low before their GOD, and riſe high in their faith; and to hold their confidence the faſter. They could not have wanted thoſe blowes in the <hi>North,</hi> no nor thoſe blowes in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> which were like thoſe ſtones thrown againſt Saint <hi>Steven, They did knocke them cloſer to their GOD.</hi> They could not have wanted that <hi>unfaithfulneſſe</hi> in ſome, nor the <hi>treacheries</hi> in others, or the <hi>weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> of others, they could not have wanted any of all this; for all this has greatly advanced the Wiſdome, Power, Goodneſſe, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of GOD. All has made His people wiſe in the wiſedome of GOD, and ſtrong in the power of His might. If they had not beene ſo weak once, they had not been ſo ſtrong now. If they had not ſeen what fooles they were, they had not been ſo wiſe now. If they had not been filled with ſorrow once, their joy had not been ſo brim-ful now. Their ſalvation could not have come ſooner, if it had, it had not been ſo well; their hearts had not been ſo prepared for mercy, for ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, ſo agreeable to His holy will. If they had not been hewed and hacked, they had not been <hi>poliſhed</hi> ſtones ſo fitted for a ſpirituall building. In a word, their ſickneſſe has beene better to them then their health; their war better to them then peace; their priſon better then liberty; their fallings before their enemy, has made them more victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; and in <hi>deaths</hi> often, has made their lives more glorious in the face of heaven and earth. Now bleſſed be GOD. Who doſt all things well, and in the beſt time, as ſhall be beſt to advance Thy glory, and Thy peoples ſalvation! Bleſſed be GOD! Why then do with Thy people what Thou wilt; take Thine own <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Way,</hi> to do with them what Thou pleaſeſt.
