1. ENGLANDS Third Alarm to VVAR, Againſt the Beaſt.

    _ SECT. III. 0200 DAvids ſtory, & Sauls perſecution is continued: his hand is reſtrained, but his heart is bloody; and men are, as their hearts are. David delivers the Keilites, yet they will deliver David, into a murtherers hand. A leſſon from thence. Saul holds-on his foot, in the path of the deſtroyer. Why does not Iſrael ſtand-up, for Iſrael, and for their (temporall) Saviour; againſt an over-bearing Lord, and an inſulting Edomite? The Anſwer will reſolve the Caſe of Conſcience; and Iſraels duty touching that matter. Saul drives-on furiouſly after David, ſeemes to proſper, gaines men, The Choſen out of all Iſrael, to carry-on his bloody deſigne; and drives David from all his ſtrong holds every one. Davids GOD looks upon all this, and ſuffers it to be done, for excellent Reaſons, relating To David, To his Adverſaries, and To GOD Himſelfe; and all relating to theſe times: David was delivered then, and he ſhall be delivered now; but not before all his ſtrong holds are caſt downe. The Tribes come▪ in at laſt, when the way was cleared before them, and all good meanes uſed firſt. All true Iſraelites will come in ſhortly, To helpe The LORD againſt THE MIGHTY, when That, which letteth, is taken away; There is the Concluſion; GODS Time is the beſt Time, beſt to Advance His Glory, and His Peoples Peace.

      * CHAP. 1. Davids ſtory and Sauls perſequution is continued; his heart as bloody as before; though after his march from Nob, hee could draw no more blood, for a Man is as his Will is. David delivers the Keilites out of the hand of ſpoilers, and the Keilites would deliver David into Sauls hands. David will doe his Duty notwithſtanding, and leave the reſt to God.

      * CHAP. II. Why did not the Neighbouring Iſraelites Come-in to help their Brethren and Siſters, grievouſly oppreſſed by a cruell Lord and a bloudy Edomite? Or why did they not relieve David now driven into the Wilderneſſe? What Saul did, and would have done is examined, and who this Edomite was? So it is made very cleare, That Conſcience could not hold-backe the neighbouring Iſraelites from ſtanding-up, every man in his place, to defend himſelfe, and to withſtand the notorious violences from Sauls and his Edomites hands.

      * CHAP. 3. This perſecution comes-up to our Times, as bloudy now as ever any was in any time. The Papiſts now of the ſame generation with the Edomites then, and as bloudy now as then. Our engagements to withſtand them: In ſo doing we ſtand for the King. What ſhould be our prayer for him; and a caſe of Conſcience touching our obedience to him, reſolved; and the chiefe Objections touching that matter.

      * CHAP. 4. Saul has ſhed bloud to his power, is reſolved to ſhed more; ſummons Iſrael to come-in for that purpoſe; They come at his call. What to thinke of his Troopers. It relates to the later and preſent time, not to diſhear•••, but to encourage all Iſrael David muſt be driven from out of all his ſtrong Holds, and forſaken of all his friends; excellent Reaſon is given why it is ſo, in the next Chapter.

      * CHAP. 5. God ſuffer'd the Adverſary to prevaile a while. To worke-out his deſignes againſt David; That thereby Davids ſpirit might be diſcovered to himſelfe; That his Adverſar•es ſpirits might bee made manifeſt alſo, and convinced: And GODS Right-hand made glorious towards David. This, in all particulars, relates to David The Faithfull of The LORD evermore.

      * CHAP. 6. Davids troubles have a happy cloſe; but his caſe is very ſad firſt. The Churches caſe now, is read in Davids caſe then; therefore we record former deliverances very wonderfull, to ſtrengthen our aſſurance in a deliverance to come, which will be more glorious the longer it ſtayes. Quere's touching Davids caſe, now at the loweſt, with reſolution from Gods mouth thereunto; which ſpeaks comfortable words to David, but ſad things to us. Our ſtrong hold•, as well as Davids, muſt be caſt downe before we are delivered.

      * CHAP. 7. A grave Queſtion reſolved, Touching the manner how a Spirit is to be reſiſted; If he acts like a Spirit, then by the ſpirit of Prayer, wherein Iſrael neither was nor is wanting: If hee acts by the hand of an Edomite, then he muſt be reſiſted by the ſword of an Iſraelite, wherein Iſrael now muſt not be wanting neither, but doe as Iſrael did, and as their Brethren in Scotland have done of late, and in ancient Times.

      * CHAP. 8. Mans extremity is Gods opportunity. David had a glorious deliverance when he was made meet for it: So ſhall the Church have, when their adverſaries have filled up their meaſures; When Gods People are purified in their furnace, then their God will ſend them glorious Saviours, and a glorious Salvation: In the meane time they hold faſt their confidence.
